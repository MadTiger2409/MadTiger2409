## Hi, I'm Michael :hand:

I'm software test automation engineer, working mostly with C#/.NET. In my free time I like to think about problems that I can solve using my skills and knowledge.

My goal is to provide people with free tools that will help them solve everyday problems, while expanding my own knowledge of various fields.

Feel free to use any of my repositories, ask me questions or suggest things that I can improve :smirk:
